TI  - Evaluation of methods for detecting recombination from DNA sequences: computer
      simulations.

AB  - Recombination is a key evolutionary process that shapes the architecture of
      genomes and the genetic structure of populations. Although many statistical
      methods are available for the detection of recombination from DNA sequences,
      their absolute and relative performance is still unknown. Here we evaluated the
      performance of 14 different recombination detection algorithms. We used the
      coalescent with recombination to simulate DNA sequences with different levels of 
      recombination, genetic diversity, and rate variation among sites. Recombination
      detection methods were applied to these data sets, and whether they detected or
      not recombination was recorded. Different recombination methods showed distinct
      performance depending on the amount of recombination, genetic diversity, and rate
      variation among sites. The model of nucleotide substitution under which the data 
      were generated did not seem to have a significant effect. Most methods increase
      power with more sequence divergence. In general, recombination detection methods 
      seem to capture the presence of recombination, but they are not very powerful.
      Methods that use substitution patterns or incompatibility among sites were more
      powerful than methods based on phylogenetic incongruence. Most methods do not
      seem to infer more false positives than expected by chance. Especially depending 
      on the amount of diversity in the data, different methods could be used to attain
      maximum power while minimizing false positives. Results shown here will provide
      some guidance in the selection of the most appropriate method/s for the analysis 
      of the particular data at hand.
