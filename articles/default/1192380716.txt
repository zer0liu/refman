TI  - Gauging acceptance of a hepatitis C test by family planning clinic attendees in
      Glasgow, UK.
PG  - 263-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the UK, pregnant women are not offered and recommended a hepatitis
      C virus (HCV) test because no effective intervention to prevent vertical
      transmission of HCV exists following conception. Mother-to-child transmission of 
      HCV could, however, be reduced if infected women planning to have children
      underwent a course of therapy prior to conception. OBJECTIVE: To determine what
      proportion of female family planning clinic (FPC) attendees would hypothetically 
      accept an HCV test if they were offered it and to identify the factors associated
      with such a decision. METHODS: Opportunistic sampling was used to recruit 1000
      women attending FPCs in Glasgow during 2002/2003. Participants were asked to
      self-complete a brief questionnaire about HCV and testing. RESULTS: Of 964
      participants, 62% reported that they would accept an HCV test if it was offered
      in the family planning setting and 24% indicated that they were undecided. Only
      4% of women reported that they would be offended if offered an HCV test. The
      highest rates of hypothetical acceptance of an HCV test were reported among those
      who had ever injected drugs (88%) and those who felt that they were at risk of
      being infected with HCV (84%). Women who were single [adjusted odds ratio (OR)
      1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.8] and who were of non-white ethnic origin (adjusted OR 2.5,
      95% CI 1.0-6.2) were also significantly more inclined to hypothetically accept an
      HCV test. CONCLUSION: Selective HCV testing to those women at high risk of HCV
      infection should be encouraged in the family planning setting.

TI  - Interactive effects of immunoglobulin gamma and human leucocyte antigen genotypes
      on clearance and persistence of infection with hepatitis C virus.
AB  - Particular alleles of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) and immunoglobulin gamma (GM)
      and immunoglobulin kappa (KM) allotypes (polymorphic determinants of IgG heavy
      chains and kappa-type light chains, respectively) are associated with the outcome
      of several infections. To examine their role in the outcome of hepatitis C virus 
      (HCV) infection, we genotyped 50 individuals with resolved and 117 with
      persistent HCV infection. None of the GM, KM or HLA-C genotypes by themselves
      were associated with the resolution or persistence of HCV infection. However,
      particular combinations of HLA and GM genotypes were associated significantly
      with the outcome of HCV infection. Subjects with the HLA C1C1 genotype, in the
      absence of GM ff, were more than seven times [odds ratio (OR) 7.15] as likely to 
      have persistent infection as the subjects who lacked both these genotypes. The
      presence of GM ff, in the absence of HLA C1C2, was associated with the resolution
      of infection (OR 0.27). The absence of GM fz, in the presence of HLA C2C2, was
      also associated with the resolution of infection (OR 0.27). Compared to the
      subjects who lacked both these genotypes, subjects with GM fz, in the absence of 
      HLA C1C2, were almost four times as likely to have persistent infection (OR
      3.91); similarly, subjects with HLA C1C2, in the absence of GM fz, were almost
      three times as likely to have persistent infection (OR 2.80). These results show,
      for the first time, interactive effects of GM and HLA genotypes in the outcome of
      HCV infection.

TI  - Cytokines and growth factors in mostly atherosclerotic patients on hemodialysis
      determined by biochip array technology.
PG  - 1347-52
AB  - Background: The lifespan of patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) is reduced,
      and coronary artery disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in
      these patients. The progression of atherosclerosis is accelerated and
      angiogenesis is impaired in CRF. Risk factors that could contribute to further
      understanding of vascular pathology include markers of inflammation and growth
      factors. The purpose of this study was to determine the levels of cytokines
      (IL-2, IL4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta), vascular endothelial growth 
      factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), tumor 
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in
      patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD; n=75), and to compare values with those of 
      control subjects (n=113). Methods: Evidence((R)) biochip array analyzer was used 
      for quantification of plasma concentrations in samples. Results: Significant
      differences were found between the control subjects and HD patients. IL-2
      (p<0.001), IL-4 (p<0.001) and EGF (p<0.001) levels were higher in controls than
      in HD patients, while IL-6 (p<0.001), IL-8 (p=0.081), IL-10 (p=0.008), TNFalpha
      (p<0.001), IL-1beta (p<0.001) and MCP-1 (p<0.001) levels were higher in HD
      patients. We also found IL-2 (p=0.015) and IL-1alpha (p=0.035) levels to be
      significantly higher in males than females, while IL-4 (p=0.025) and IL-1beta
      (p=0.049) levels were significantly higher in females. Among HD patients, IL-2
      levels were higher in patients under the age of 50 years (p<0.048). It was also
      higher in female than in male patients (p<0.035) and in patients on HD for more
      than 10 years (p<0.009). IL-6 levels were higher in patients over the age of 50
      years (p<0.047). Patients with previous glomerulonephritis had the highest level 
      of IL-6 compared to patients with previous pyelonephritis and diabetes mellitus
      (p<0.063). IL-6 levels were higher in patients with concomitant hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) infection (p<0.036) and in patients with developed atherosclerosis
      (p<0.003). IL-8 levels were higher in patients over the age of 50 years (p<0.003)
      and in the group with previous glomerulonephritis (p<0.031). IL-10 levels were
      higher in the group with developed atherosclerosis (p<0.045). EGF was the highest
      in the group of patients with previous diabetes mellitus compared to
      pyelonephritis and glomerulonephritis groups (p<0.073). TNFalpha levels were
      higher in the patient population on HD for more than 10 years (p<0.032) and in
      the concomitant HCV group (p<0.073). IL-1beta levels were higher in the HCV group
      (p<0.088). Conclusions: Plasma concentrations of some cytokines and growth
      factors could serve as useful diagnostic and prognostic parameters for patients
      with CRF on HD. Clin Chem Lab Med 2007;45:1347-52.

TI  - Awareness of Hepatitis C Infection Among Women With and At Risk for HIV.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment guidelines recommend all HIV/HCV-co-infected persons be
      considered for hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, yet obstacles to testing and
      accessing treatment for HCV continue for women. OBJECTIVE: To assess awareness of
      HCV, and describe diagnostic referrals and HCV treatment among women in the
      Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). DESIGN: Prospective epidemiologic cohort.
      PARTICIPANTS: Of 3,768 HIV-infected and uninfected women in WIHS, 1,166 (31%)
      were HCV antibody positive. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Awareness of HCV
      infection and probability of referrals for diagnostic evaluations and treatment
      using logistic regression. Follow-up HCV information was available for 681 (390
      died, 15 withdrew, 80 missed visit) in 2004. Of these 681, 522 (76.7%) reported
      knowing their HCV diagnosis. Of these, 247 of 522 (47.3%) stated their providers 
      recommended a liver biopsy, whereas 139 of 247 or 56.3% reported having a liver
      biopsy. A total of 170 of 522 (32.6%) reported being offered treatment and 74.1% 
      (n = 126 of 170) reported receiving HCV treatment. In multivariate regression
      analyses, African-American race, Hispanic/Latina ethnicity, poverty, and current 
      crack/cocaine/heroin use were negatively associated with treatment referrals,
      whereas elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was associated with increased
      likelihood of referral and increased likelihood of treatment. CONCLUSION: One
      quarter of women with HCV in this cohort were not aware of their diagnosis. Among
      those aware of their HCV, 1 in 4 received liver biopsy and treatment for HCV.
      Both provider and patient education interventions regarding HCV testing and HCV
      treatment options and guidelines are needed to enhance HCV awareness and
      participation in HCV evaluation and treatment.

TI  - [HIV, HCV, HBV and syphilis infections among blood donors in Germany 2005. Report
      from the Robert Koch Institute in accordance with Article 22 of the Transfusion
      Act.]
PG  - 1221-1231
AB  - The Robert Koch Institute collects and evaluates data on the prevalence and
      incidence of HIV, hepatitis C (HCV), hepatitis B (HBV) and syphilis infections
      among blood and plasma donors in Germany according to article 22 of the
      Transfusion Act. The surveillance data permit an assessment of the occurrence of 
      infections in the blood donor population and consequently the safety of the
      collected donations. This report includes data from all blood donation services
      in Germany for 2005. In total, 6.26 million donations or blood samples from
      prospective donors were screened. The prevalence of the relevant infections was
      6.1/100,000 for HIV, 81.2/100,000 for HCV, 143.9/100,000 for HBV and 35.6/100,000
      donations for syphilis. The rate of seroconversions/100,000 donations was 0.9 for
      HIV, 1.4 for HCV, 0.9 for HBV and 2.3 for syphilis. The analysis showed a very
      low incidence of infections with a decreasing trend for HCV infections among
      first time donors and an increase in incident HIV and syphilis infections since
      1999. The latter has to be monitored carefully and possible causes need to be
      evaluated.
