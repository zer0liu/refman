TI  - Vaccination Against Hepatitis C Virus With Dendritic Cells Transduced With an
      Adenovirus Encoding NS3 Protein.
AB  - Chronic infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV) is characterized by the absence of
      efficient antiviral T-cell responses. Thus, vaccination strategies to induce
      strong anti-HCV T-cell responses are of paramount importance for prophylactic and
      therapeutic purposes. Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent antigen
      presenting cells; therefore, immunization with these cells loaded with viral
      antigens offers a new approach for induction of antiviral immunity. Here we show 
      that immunization with DCs transfected with an adenovirus encoding non-structural
      3 protein, from HCV (AdNS3), induced multiepitopic CD4 T helper cell 1 (Th1) and 
      CD8 T-cell responses in different mouse strains. These responses prevented the
      growth of a tumorexpressing HCV proteins, in short- and long-term experiments.
      Moreover, immunization with AdNS3-transfected DCs did not induce anti-adenoviral 
      antibodies, as compared to direct immunization with AdNS3, but elicited T-cell
      responses even in the presence of pre-existing anti-adenoviral antibodies.
      Finally, responses induced by this protocol down-regulated the expression of HCV 
      RNA in the liver. In conclusion, DCs transfected with AdNS3 may prove to be an
      efficient anti-HCV vaccine.Molecular Therapy doi:10.1038/sj.mt.6300333.
